# Hangman Game - With Canvas

## What is this?

This is a simple hang-man game using canvas to draw the visuals. This game can be playied as singleplayer or with in pair.

At the momment, only a single player can play the game with a few words stored inside.

## How to play?

The interface is straightfoward. The page prompts you if you want to select a word from a small word bank (singleplayer), or if you want to create your own prompts (2 or more players).

After selecting (and writing your word), the other player(s) must write a letter into the prompt to guess the secret word.

These rules have been created by me to have a quick start. You may opt to follow, edit or create new rules to implement.
